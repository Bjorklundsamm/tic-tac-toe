## Description
Practice time attack sprint as a form of self assessment; following recommended prompts of
the Galvanize Software Engineer coding challenges. Project approached with the following self-implemented constraints:
- [x] Must run exclusively in the console
- [x] Must offer a display for users to interact with
- [x] Must properly detect standard win conditions
- [x] Must not use any non-native dependencies
- [x] Must be completed from scratch within 90 minutes

All goals were met, tested, and exceeded with additional optimizations within just under 80 minutes. Note additional
features of game including cheat prevention and an automatic board resetting on a confirmed win. Have fun!

## Usage
Game can be launched with standard node launch commands:
```
npm start
node app.js
```

### Libraries used
